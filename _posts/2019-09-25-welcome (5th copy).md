Hi, this is the first blog post on my new homepage; I have recently migrated form IITK hosting to \*.github.io hosting. This page is built using Jekyll. The code is well documented, should you need to make a fork for your own homepage. This blog post is just to test the tags and categories features of the blog section. I hope that in the near future I will be putting up a lot of content.
