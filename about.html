## About

If you've found your way to this page, you're probably trying to get to know more about me. First things first : Coding = crying XD

Hi, my name is Tejesh Vaish. I am a rising Sophomore at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I am a tech enthusiast; broadly interested in Machine Learning, programming languages and Algorithms. I am fairly proficient at NLP and CNN. I love to learn. I install various application's in my free time. I like to characterize myself as a geek-strovert (yes, I coined the term). I love conversations about technology, games and philosophy and just about anything!. Side Note, I put the _pro_ in procrastination.

In another world, I was a (self-proclaimed) brilliant science student when I appeared for the Joint Entrance Examination (_supposedly the toughest in the world_) where I managed to sneak by with a rank of 1068 (among almost a million candidates, so maybe that was impressive).
